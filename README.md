# Diabetes_prediction

This Python application is designed to classify diabetes based on a given dataset using two different classifiers: Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. The application allows users to browse for a CSV dataset, specify the percentage of data to use, and then runs the classifiers on the dataset, displaying the accuracy of each classifier and predictions for the test data.
